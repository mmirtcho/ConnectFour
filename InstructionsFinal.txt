Instructions for building the system:
1) Follow this link https://github.com/mmirtcho/ConnectFour and download all of the documents located in the repository
2) Place the content in the single folder(directory).
3) Locate and launch cmd.exe
4) Navigate cmd to the directory, where you placed all of the files
5) Type: make

Instructions for running unit tests:
1) Steps 1-5 from previous instructions
2) To test each function just type: ls  (to see which funtions are there to test).
3) After that go through each executable and ./(Name of executable)
4) Some will require user input, so you can test incorrect values, such as 33 as difficulty or 10 as move

Instructions for running Acceptance test (cucumber required):
1) Navigate to test folder in the ConnectFour directory and type: cucumber
2) If step 1 doesn't work please follow steps 1-5 for building the system and copy the executable (connectfour) into the tests folder. This should overrride our execubale that was provided beacuse it is incompatable with your system.
3) This test is fully automatic and doesn't require user contribution (it tests program as a whole)

Instructions for running the system
1) steps 1-5 from instructions for building system
2) Type: ./connectfour
3) You will be taken to : Please enter the Difficulty (1=Easy, 10=Hard): (enter any number from 1 to 10)
4) Board will be displayed if the number entered is in correct range. After that you will need to enter a move ranging from 1 to 7 (number of columns) and unless the column is full “O” symbol will be placed in that column.
5) Repeat 4 until you win or loose

Note: our AI (artificial intelligence) is not perfect, so the larger the difficulty, longer it takes for computer to respond during the first few moves. Suggested difficulty: 1 to 5
