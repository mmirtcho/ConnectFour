Instructions for building system
1) Follow this link https://github.com/mmirtcho/ConnectFour and download all of the documents located in the repository
2) Place the content in the single folder(directory).
3) Locate and launch cmd.exe
4) Navigate cmd to the directory, where you placed all of the files
5) Type: make

Instructions for running the unit tests
1) steps 1-5 from previous instructions
2) Type: ./connectfour < input.txt > output.txt (this will run connectfour using inputs from the input.txt and place all of the outputs into the output.txt)
3) To check the correctness of the output. Type: diff output.txt expexted_output.txt (expected_output.txt was manually made by us, it includes expected output, when given inputs from input.txt) diff compares the content of 2 files and if nothing shows up, then 2 files are identical.
4) Repeat same process for input2.txt and input3.txt, checking output with expected_output2.txt and expected_output3.txt.

Note: input.txt consists of bad difficulty values and computer winning, input2.txt consists of bad move values and computer winning, while input3.txt consists of all good values and player winning.

Instructions for running the system
1) steps 1-5 from instructions for building system
2) Type: ./connectfour
3) You will be taken to : Please enter the Difficulty (1=Easy, 10=Hard): (enter any number from 1 to 10)
4) Board will be displayed if the number entered is in correct range. After that you will need to enter a move ranging from 1 to 7 (number of columns) and unless the column is full “o” symbol will be placed in that column.
5) Repeat 4 until you win or loose

Note: our AI (artificial intelligence) is not perfect, so the larger the difficulty, longer it takes for computer to respond during the first few moves. Suggested difficulty: 1 to 5
